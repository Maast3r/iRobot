iRobot
======

Uses an iRobot vacuum machine or iRobot Simulator to do things (ie. PID, play music, go to listed coordinates etc.)

To use, run the Master class.

You can vary the speed, angle of turn, and the duration of movement for basic controls.
You can ask the robot to:
  move in "fancy" movements
  Go to coordinates or waypoints that the user specifies
  Follow a black line using PID
  Go until it hits a wall
  Sing and Dance
  Send and Receive IR messages
  and be controlled by an Xbox Controller
