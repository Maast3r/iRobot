Your TASKS file:
  1. Helps you keep track of what TASKS you have ahead of you,
       and when they are due.
  2. Lets your other team members know the status of your tasks.
  3. Lets your instructor monitor the volume of your work.

EVERYTHING that you do for this project is a TASK.
  -- Use chunks of 0.5 to 2 hours.
  -- Record ALL your work for the project, whether in-class or out,
       in your TASKS file.

YOU MUST:
   1. At the BEGINNING of EVERY work session (in-class or out):
        Add new tasks to your TASKS file as needed to indicate
        what YOU will be doing in the next 1 to 3 work sessions.
        Use the TEMPLATE in the file; one line per task.
      
   2. At the END of EVERY work session (in-class or out):
        a. Put your hours worked, assigning them to listed tasks.
             Approximate is fine.
        b. Update the STATUS of tasks as needed.
        c. Add new tasks as needed to indicate what YOU will be doing
             in the next 1 to 3 work sessions.
