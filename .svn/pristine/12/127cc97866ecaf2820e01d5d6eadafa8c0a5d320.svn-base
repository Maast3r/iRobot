LOG
Sprint ending 11-1 5.5-hours of dedicated work
I have completed task 3b.
I used joy-to-key to program a wired after-glow x-box 360 remote so that the keys would act
like a key press. These buttons work in al programs.

In addition, I made Xbox_And_KeyBoard.py which allows the controler of the robot to use 
key board keys and by extension the remote.
